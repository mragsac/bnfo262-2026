# Introduction to Statistics

**Lecturer**: Michelle Franc Ragsac, Ph.D. (mragsac@ucsd.edu), Postdoctoral Scholar - Amariuta Lab

In this module, we will cover some of the basic concepts in statistics (e.g., population versus sample mean, variance, and standard deviation; discrete versus continuous random variables) and explore data exploration and visualization in Python (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) using the Palmer Penguins dataset.

## Ad Hoc Lecture

We also had an improv programming session during Day 1 where we installed `conda`, along with common data science packages (e.g., `python`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `jupyterlab`) to our personal computers to run the notebooks for this module. If you are interested in the notes for that segment, they are uploaded to this directory as `00_Introduction-to-Statistics_Ad-Hoc-Lecture.md`.
